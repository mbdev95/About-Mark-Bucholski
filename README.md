# About 

I have completed a course in Front-end web development from the online school called OpenClassrooms. Throughout the course I built a skillset covering the important areas of Front-end web development including CSS, SCSS/SASS, HTML, Bootstrap, WordPress, JavaScript, REST APIs, jQuery, React, MVC, Behaviour-Driven Development, and Test-Driven Development.  In addition, I also learned MySQL and completed a database using MySQL for one of the OpenClassrooms projects.  My Front-end projects from OpenClassrooms on GitHub include: creating a web page for a film festival using CSS/Bootstrap, a quotation generator which functions using vanilla JavaScript, a board game built using object-oriented JavaScript and jQuery, a restaurant review app which accesses information via APIs and is built with React, and finally a todo list app which I debugged, added tests, and wrote a performance analysis/technical documentation.  Most recently, I have created a portfolio website using SCSS and React. Furthermore, I created a 3D animation using A-Frame, AR.js and Blender.  Also, I have completed an Upskilling program run by Harvest Builders where I learned a new tech stack.  This tech stack includes MongoDB, GraphQL, Jest, TypeScript and Node.js.  I am committed to being a developer for the long-term.  I want to continue to learn and grow as a developer indefinetly.

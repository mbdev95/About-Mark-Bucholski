Hey, my name is Mark and I am currently learning front-end web development. I have learned css, html, MySQL, bootstrap, WordPress, JavaScript, jQuery and react.  
In my github repository I will be posting and have posted the various projects I have worked on and will be working on in the future, in an effort to showcase my skills as a front end web developer.

# About Mark Bucholski

I have recently finished a course in Front-end web development from the online school called OpenClassrooms. Throughout the course I built a necessary skillset covering the important areas of Front-end web development including CSS, SCSS/SASS, HTML, Bootstrap, WordPress, JavaScript, APIs, jQuery, React, MVC, Behaviour-Driven Development, and Test-Driven Development.  In addition, I also learned mySQL and completed a database using mySQL for one of the OpenClassrooms projects.  My Front-end projects from OpenClassrooms on GitHub include creating a web page for a film festival using CSS/Bootstrap, a quotation generator which functions using vanilla JavaScript, a board game built using object-oriented JavaScript and jQuery, a restaurant review app which accesses information via APIs and is built with React, and finally a todo list app which I debugged, added tests, and wrote a perfomance analysis/technical documentation.  In the future I plan to add to this portfolio of work by creating my own personal website to showcase my portfolio in a well designed website.  Furthermore, I plan on creating a website for the cost of a domain for a small business or charity.  The OpenClassrooms projects and my future projects illustrate my understanding of the skills and best practices required to be an effective, efficient and eager Front-end web developer.
